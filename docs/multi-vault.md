## Architecture Overview

A multi-vault deployment consists of:

- **Multiple `AuraVault` contract instances**, each holding a distinct SEP-41 underlying token and maintaining independent share accounting.
- **`AuraStrategy`** (EVM sidechain / Solidity) — deployed once per vault that uses the strategy layer; routes assets between Aave and Compound for yield.
- **`AuraPriceOracle`** (EVM sidechain / Solidity) — shared across vaults; provides normalized Chainlink price feeds for alternate-token harvest conversions.
- **`VaultAccessControl`** (EVM sidechain / Solidity) — shared RBAC contract that grants admin, strategy manager, operator, and support roles across all vaults.
- **Backend API** — a single Express.js service that routes requests to the correct vault contract based on a `vaultId` path parameter.
- **Frontend** — a `VaultComparison` component for selecting a vault and a `VaultDashboard` for interacting with the chosen vault.

## Factory Contract Interaction Pattern

There is no on-chain factory contract for Soroban vault instances. Each `AuraVault` is deployed independently using the standard Stellar CLI deployment pattern. The "factory" is the deployment pipeline in CI/CD.

### Deploying a New Vault

**Step 1 — Build and upload the Wasm (if not already uploaded)**

```bash
cd aura-vault
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/aura_vault.wasm \
  --source <deployer-keypair> \
  --network mainnet
# Outputs: <WASM_HASH>
```

The Wasm hash is shared across all vault instances that run the same contract version. You only need to upload once per version.

**Step 2 — Deploy a new vault instance**

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash <WASM_HASH> \
  --source <deployer-keypair> \
  --network mainnet
# Outputs: <CONTRACT_ID>
```

**Step 3 — Initialize the vault**

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <admin-keypair> \
  --network mainnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --underlying_token <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --signers '[
    {"address": "<SIGNER_1>"},
    {"address": "<SIGNER_2>"},
    {"address": "<SIGNER_3>"}
  ]'
```

**Step 4 — Register in the vault registry** (see [Vault Registry Management](#vault-registry-management))

### Re-using the Same Wasm Hash

All vault instances for the same contract version share the same Wasm hash. This means:
- A `register_yield_token` call on Vault A does not affect Vault B.
- An `upgrade` call must be performed separately on each vault instance.
- Fee configuration (`set_fees`, `set_treasury`) is per-instance.

---

## Vault Registry Management

The vault registry is a configuration file maintained in the repository at `docs/vault-registry.json` (or an equivalent configuration managed by the team). It is the authoritative source for vault metadata and is consumed by the backend at startup.

### Registry Schema

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "vaults": [
    {
      "id": "usdc-main",
      "name": "USDC Vault",
      "contractId": "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
      "underlyingToken": "CBC...",
      "underlyingSymbol": "USDC",
      "underlyingDecimals": 6,
      "network": "mainnet",
      "chainId": "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015",
      "status": "active",
      "strategyAddress": "0x...",
      "minDeposit": 1000000,
      "feesBps": 200,
      "deployedAt": "2026-10-15",
      "tags": ["stable", "primary"]
    },
    {
      "id": "xlm-main",
      "name": "XLM Vault",
      "contractId": "CBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB",
      "underlyingToken": "native",
      "underlyingSymbol": "XLM",
      "underlyingDecimals": 7,
      "network": "mainnet",
      "chainId": "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015",
      "status": "active",
      "strategyAddress": "0x...",
      "minDeposit": 10000000,
      "feesBps": 100,
      "deployedAt": "2026-10-15",
      "tags": ["native", "primary"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Registry Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Stable identifier used in API paths and frontend routing. Lowercase, hyphenated. |
| `name` | string | Human-readable display name |
| `contractId` | string | Stellar contract ID (starts with `C`) |
| `underlyingToken` | string | SEP-41 token contract ID, or `"native"` for XLM |
| `underlyingSymbol` | string | Token symbol for display |
| `underlyingDecimals` | integer | Decimal places for the token |
| `network` | string | `"mainnet"` or `"testnet"` |
| `status` | string | `"active"`, `"paused"`, or `"deprecated"` |
| `strategyAddress` | string | EVM sidechain strategy contract address (optional) |
| `minDeposit` | integer | Minimum deposit in token's smallest unit |
| `feesBps` | integer | Performance fee in basis points |
| `deployedAt` | string | ISO 8601 deployment date |
| `tags` | string[] | Optional tags for filtering (`"stable"`, `"native"`, `"experimental"`) |

### Adding a New Vault to the Registry

1. Deploy the vault contract (Steps 1–3 above).
2. Add an entry to `docs/vault-registry.json` with `"status": "active"`.
3. Open a PR. CI will validate the registry schema.
4. After merge, the backend picks up the new vault on the next deployment.

### Deprecating a Vault

1. Pause the vault on-chain: `stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- pause`
2. Update the registry entry: change `"status"` from `"active"` to `"deprecated"`.
3. The backend will stop accepting new deposits and the frontend will show a deprecation banner.
4. After all users have withdrawn, set `"status": "archived"`.

## Per-Vault Configuration Options

Each vault instance is configured independently on-chain. The following settings are per-vault:

### On-Chain Per-Vault Settings

| Setting | Function | Who Can Call | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin address | Set via `initialize` | Deployer | Can be changed via governance proposal |
| Underlying token | Set via `initialize` | Deployer | Immutable after initialization |
| Governance signers | Set via `initialize` | Deployer | Can be changed via governance proposal |
| Pause state | `pause()` / `unpause()` | Admin | Per-instance |
| Performance fee (bps) | `set_fees(bps)` | Admin | e.g., `200` = 2% |
| Treasury address | `set_treasury(addr)` | Admin | Receives fee withdrawals |
| Registered yield tokens | `register_yield_token(token)` | Admin | Per-instance whitelist for `harvest_token` |
| Contract Wasm | `upgrade(wasm_hash)` | Admin | Must be done separately per instance |

### Off-Chain Per-Vault Settings (Registry)

| Setting | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum deposit | `docs/vault-registry.json` → `minDeposit` | Enforced in the frontend and API validation |
| Display name | `docs/vault-registry.json` → `name` | Used in UI |
| Tags | `docs/vault-registry.json` → `tags` | Used for filtering in `VaultComparison` |
| Strategy contract | `docs/vault-registry.json` → `strategyAddress` | Links vault to its EVM strategy |

---

## Supporting Contracts

### AuraStrategy (`contracts/strategy/AuraStrategy.sol`)

`AuraStrategy` deploys vault assets into Aave v2/v3 (primary) or Compound (fallback) for yield generation. One strategy instance can serve one vault.

**Key roles:**

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | Full control: configure protocols, pause, upgrade |
| `STRATEGY_MANAGER_ROLE` | Deploy/redeploy assets, adjust allocations |
| `OPERATOR_ROLE` | Trigger harvests, emergency withdrawals |

**Key parameters per strategy instance:**

| Parameter | Setter Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Primary protocol | `setProtocol(Protocol.AAVE)` | Aave or Compound |
| Aave pool address | `setLendingPool(addr)` | Aave v2/v3 pool |
| Compound cToken | `setCompoundToken(addr)` | Fallback protocol token |
| Min tokens for health | `MIN_TOKENS = 5` | Constant — strategy needs ≥ 5 registered tokens |
| Stale harvest threshold | `HARVEST_STALE_THRESHOLD = 48h` | After 48h without harvest, `staleHarvest = true` |

**Health check:**

```solidity
strategy.healthCheck();
// Returns: { isHealthy, hasMinTokens, staleHarvest, protocolBalance }
```

A `staleHarvest` flag indicates the keeper has not run in 48 hours. This should trigger an alert in Grafana.

### AuraPriceOracle (`contracts/oracle/AuraPriceOracle.sol`)

A shared Chainlink oracle with 1-hour on-chain price cache, decimal normalization to 18 dp, primary/fallback feed support, and an emergency pause when price deviation exceeds 5%.

One oracle instance is shared across all vaults that use `harvest_token`.

**Registering a price feed:**

```solidity
oracle.setFeed(
  tokenAddress,
  primaryFeedAddress,   // Chainlink AggregatorV3
  fallbackFeedAddress   // address(0) for no fallback
);
```

**Getting a price:**

```solidity
uint256 price = oracle.getPrice(tokenAddress);
// Returns: price normalized to 18 decimal places
// Gas: ~3k (cache hit), ~45k (cache miss)
```

**Emergency behavior:** If the live price deviates more than 5% from the cached price, the oracle pauses automatically and emits an `EmergencyPaused` event. Only an account with `OPERATOR_ROLE` can unpause.

### VaultAccessControl (`contracts/access/VaultAccessControl.sol`)

Shared RBAC contract used across all vaults and strategy instances. One deployment serves the entire protocol.

**Roles:**

| Role | Granted To | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | Protocol multisig | All privileged operations |
| `STRATEGY_MANAGER_ROLE` | Strategy team accounts | Deploy strategies, adjust allocations |
| `OPERATOR_ROLE` | Keeper bots, ops accounts | Trigger harvests, emergency withdrawals |
| `SUPPORT_ROLE` | Support team accounts | Read user data, perform support actions |

**Batch role grants (for onboarding new operators):**

```solidity
accessControl.batchGrantRoles(
  [OPERATOR_ROLE, OPERATOR_ROLE],
  [keeper1Address, keeper2Address]
);
```

## Backend Multi-Vault Routing

The backend Express.js API routes requests to the correct vault based on a `vaultId` path parameter. The vault registry is loaded at startup and cached in memory.

### API Endpoint Structure

```
GET  /api/v1/vaults                  — list all registered vaults
GET  /api/v1/vaults/:id              — get vault metadata from registry
GET  /api/v1/vaults/:id/stats        — get live stats (TVL, APY, shares)
POST /api/v1/vaults/:id/deposit      — submit a deposit transaction
POST /api/v1/vaults/:id/withdraw     — submit a withdrawal transaction
POST /api/v1/vaults/:id/harvest      — trigger a harvest (keeper use)
GET  /api/v1/vaults/:id/positions    — list positions for authenticated user
```

The `:id` parameter corresponds to the `id` field in the vault registry (e.g., `usdc-main`, `xlm-main`).

### How Vault Routing Works

The backend resolves the contract ID from the registry at request time:

```typescript
// Pseudocode — actual implementation in backend/src/routes/vaultRoutes.ts
import vaultRegistry from "../../docs/vault-registry.json";

function getVaultById(id: string) {
  const vault = vaultRegistry.vaults.find(v => v.id === id && v.status === "active");
  if (!vault) throw new ApiError(404, `Vault '${id}' not found`);
  return vault;
}

vaultRouter.get("/:id/stats", async (req, res) => {
  const vault = getVaultById(req.params.id);
  const stats = await getVaultStats(vault.contractId, vault.underlyingDecimals);
  res.json(stats);
});
```

### Caching Strategy

Each vault's stats are cached independently in Redis:

| Cache Key Pattern | TTL | Invalidation Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `vault:stats:{vaultId}:current` | 60 seconds | Harvest event webhook |
| `vault:positions:{address}` | 30 seconds | Any transaction for that address |
| `vault:apy:{vaultId}` | 5 minutes | APY snapshot update |

Cache keys are namespaced by `vaultId` to prevent cross-vault contamination.

### Health Checks for Multi-Vault

The backend exposes a per-vault health check:

```
GET /api/v1/vaults/:id/health
Response: {
  "vaultId": "usdc-main",
  "contractReachable": true,
  "isPaused": false,
  "lastHarvestAge": 3600,
  "staleHarvest": false,
  "rpcLatencyMs": 145
}
```

---

## Frontend Vault Selector UI

### VaultComparison Component

The `VaultComparison` component renders a sortable comparison table of all active vaults. It is the primary entry point for vault selection.

**Props:**

```typescript
interface VaultInfo {
  id: string;           // vault registry ID, used for routing
  name: string;
  underlyingToken: string;
  apy: number;          // percentage
  tvl: number;          // USD
  fee: number;          // percentage
  minDeposit: number;   // in token units
}

interface VaultComparisonProps {
  vaults: VaultInfo[];
  onDeposit: (vaultId: string) => void;
}
```

**Usage in a page:**

```tsx
import { VaultComparison, VaultInfo } from "@/components/VaultComparison";

export default function VaultsPage() {
  const { data: vaults } = useVaultList(); // fetches /api/v1/vaults

  function handleDeposit(vaultId: string) {
    router.push(`/dashboard?vault=${vaultId}`);
  }

  return <VaultComparison vaults={vaults} onDeposit={handleDeposit} />;
}
```

**Columns displayed:**

| Column | Sortable | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vault Name | Yes | Links to vault dashboard |
| Underlying Token | Yes | Displayed as symbol (USDC, XLM, etc.) |
| APY | Yes | Highest value highlighted in green |
| TVL | Yes | Highest value highlighted in green |
| Fee | Yes | Lowest value highlighted in green |
| Min Deposit | Yes | Lowest value highlighted in green |

The best-value cell in each numeric column is highlighted to help users identify the most favorable option.

### VaultDashboard Component

`VaultDashboard` is the single-vault interaction view, shown after vault selection.

**Props:**

```typescript
interface VaultDashboardProps {
  vaultId: string;       // from URL param or VaultComparison selection
}
```

The component fetches vault stats and user positions for the given `vaultId`:

```
GET /api/v1/vaults/{vaultId}/stats
GET /api/v1/vaults/{vaultId}/positions
```

**Key panels:**

- **Stat cards**: TVL, APY, user balance (tokens), user shares, price-per-share
- **Transaction history**: paginated list of deposit/withdraw/harvest events for the connected wallet
- **Vault Actions**: deposit, withdraw, harvest buttons that route to the correct vault contract

### URL Structure for Multi-Vault

```
/                           — landing page
/vaults                     — VaultComparison (all vaults)
/dashboard?vault=usdc-main  — VaultDashboard for USDC vault
/dashboard?vault=xlm-main   — VaultDashboard for XLM vault
/dashboard                  — defaults to the first active vault in the registry
```

The `vault` query parameter is the vault registry `id`. The dashboard reads `searchParams.get("vault")` and passes it to `VaultDashboard` as `vaultId`.

### Deprecated Vault Banner

When a vault's status is `"deprecated"` in the registry, the frontend shows a persistent warning banner:

```
⚠️  This vault is deprecated. Please withdraw your funds and move to [recommended vault].
    Deposits are disabled. Withdrawals remain available.
```

Deposit buttons are disabled for deprecated vaults. Withdrawal remains available until the vault is archived.

### Adding a New Vault to the Frontend

1. Add the vault to the registry (see [Vault Registry Management](#vault-registry-management)).
2. The `/api/v1/vaults` endpoint will include the new vault automatically.
3. The `VaultComparison` component fetches from this endpoint — no frontend code change is needed for a standard vault.
4. If the vault requires custom UI (non-standard token, special harvest flow), create a new entry in the frontend's vault-specific config:

```typescript
// frontend/src/lib/vaultConfig.ts
export const VAULT_OVERRIDES: Record<string, Partial<VaultUIConfig>> = {
  "exotic-vault": {
    warningBanner: "This vault uses an experimental yield strategy.",
    depositLabel: "Stake",
    withdrawLabel: "Unstake",
  },
};
```

---

## Naming Conventions

### Vault ID Format

```
{token-symbol}-{instance-label}
```

Examples:
- `usdc-main` — primary USDC vault
- `xlm-main` — primary XLM vault
- `eurc-main` — primary EURC vault
- `usdc-v2` — second-generation USDC vault (after migration from `usdc-main`)
- `usdc-testnet` — testnet USDC vault

Rules:
- Lowercase only
- Hyphens as separators
- `main` for the primary instance of a given token
- `testnet` suffix for non-production instances
- Version suffix (`v2`, `v3`) only after a vault migration; old vault is deprecated simultaneously

### Stellar Contract ID

Soroban contract IDs are 56-character uppercase strings starting with `C`. Store them in the registry exactly as returned by the Stellar CLI — do not abbreviate.

### EVM Contract Addresses

Store in checksummed format (mixed case, EIP-55). The registry uses lowercase for consistency, but code that passes addresses to contracts must use checksummed form.

### Branch Naming for Vault Deployments

When deploying a new vault, use the branch naming convention:

```
deploy/vault-{vault-id}-{network}
# Examples:
deploy/vault-eurc-main-mainnet
deploy/vault-usdc-v2-testnet
```
